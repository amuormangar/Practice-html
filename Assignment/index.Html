    <p style="color: cornflowerblue;font-size: large;">My first week at AkiraChix was full of awe and adventures.The school was beyond my expectation,the view,the location and the welcoming was so warming.

    </p>
    <span style="color: cornflowerblue;font-size: large;">I was amazed by everything i set my eyes on.I could get accessed to whatever i needed.i got the first priority of choosing my own bed and of course i chose the best.
